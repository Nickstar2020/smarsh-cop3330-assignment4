class mainMenu {
    create an array (size 100) of todoList's
    (maybe would be better to make a stack or something inside so that it's easier to remove them/ add them)

    open the mainMenu_gui_AS4

    createNewTodo {
        create a test case with no todoList in it
        * run the createNewTodo method
        * enter a name, date, and desc. for the test list
        * test case should pass if the list exists in the array, and also if the data composed of the list matches the inputted data 
    }

    deleteTodo {
        create a test case with a list already in it
        * run the deleteTodo method
        * test case should pass if the todoList no longer exists in the array
    }

    editTodo {
        create a test case with a list already in it
        * run the editTodo function
        * change the name, date, and description of the list that was selected to something new
        * test case should pass if all the new changes are accurate
    }

    saveList {
        create a test case with a former list already in it
        * run the saveList function
        * test case should pass if the list that was saved, matches the saved one in the external storage
    }

    saveAllList {
        create a test case that has a set amount of lists in the program
        * run the saveAllList function by pressing the button
        * test case should pass, if all the lists are saved to the external storage drive.
    }
}
